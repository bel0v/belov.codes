  <p style="margin-top:1rem;">
    I’m a front-end developer with {workExperienceYears}+ years of experience, including {
      workExperienceYears - 2
    } in fintech. I build robust, scalable products for fast-paced, high-growth companies.
    At Revolut, Pleo, and Apron, I shipped products that scale and last. I care about clean
    code, great UX, and making complex things simple.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Skills</h3>

  <p>
    I specialise in the Frontend and Fintech domains, with a deep focus on product and UX.
    Start-up experience taught me how to build a scalable, maintainable platform from the
    ground up and what mistakes to avoid.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>TypeScript</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> are my primary languages. Sometimes I write simple
    code in Kotlin, Go, Python, Solidity, and other languages, mainly for experiments or fun
    little projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Approximate stack I use for SPAs these days:
    <br />
    React + Redux / Context API, react-query / SWR, css-in-js, Vitest + RTL, Playwright, Vite,
    Eslint + Prettier. I’d go for Nginx for a web server, and I’m comfortable with GitHub Actions
    and Docker for CI/CD.
  </p>

  <h3>Soft skills</h3>

  <p>
    Organised regular frontend knowledge-sharing sessions. Interviewed and onboarded many
    frontend team members. Presented internal and external talks. Mentored engineers, most
    of whom were promoted. Led a team of 7.

        Pleo focused on growth, with sales-lead onboarding as the main limiting factor. I
        led the Productised onboarding team (7 people). The project was successful; Pleo
        grew fast and became a unicorn valued at $4.7B.
      </p>
      <p>
        Challenges: first experience as a team lead. Product-wise — a logic-heavy branched
        onboarding flow, depending on many factors like different market regulations and
        company types.
